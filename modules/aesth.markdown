  Sensory enjoyment provided by the landscape is crucial to human well-being. ARIES supports the quantification of all these types of aesthetic value.

      ARIES' viewshed analysis is being used to help planners understand 
      the consequences of development on property value through impacts 
      on aesthetic views. Aesthetic view values were computed and used to 
	  determine property value. Views of mountains and water bodies provide 
      value to homeowners and municipal tax bases. City and regional land 
      use policies can either improve or degrade these values over time.

      Viewsheds in the arid west are particularly valuable when they 
      contain views of green vegetation - forests, wetlands, riparian areas.  
      Views are negatively impacted by large infrastructure development such 
      as transmission lines and mining projects.  Careful siting of such 
      infrastructure is thus important in order to maintain view quality in 
      the rural west. Photo credit: R.Weller/Cochise College.

      Proximity to riparian areas, water, and green vegetation 
      is highly valued in arid and semiarid environments.  With 
      increasing stress on the west's water resources, quantifying 
      values like viewsheds, proximity, and recreational potential 
      is important in supporting sound water management. Photo credit:
