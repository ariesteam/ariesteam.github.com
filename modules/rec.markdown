 Ecosystems provide settings for a hugely diverse array of 
 recreational activities. Recreational values are among the most 
 well-recognized of all ecosystem services by the public, and human 
 preferences for recreation have been well-studied by economists and 
 other social scientists. From a spatial perspective, we can map <i>sources</i> 
 of recreational value (areas capable of providing the natural setting needed 
 for a particular activity), <i>sinks</i> of recreational value (landscape 
 features that reduce those source values, if applicable), <i>users</i> of a 
 particular recreation area for a given activity, and the <i>spatial flow</i> 
 that connects users to specific recreational areas.

      The San Pedro River, which flows north from Sonora into Arizona, is 
      internationally recognized for its high biodiversity and ecological 
      significance.  The Upper San Pedro draws birders from around the world 
      to view a broad array of resident and migratory species. Photo credit:

    <strong>Recreation:</strong> The contribution of ecosystems toward providing diverse 
	outdoor recreational opportunities such as hiking, bird watching, hunting, kayaking, etc.

    <strong>Viewsheds and recreation:</strong> The benefit resulting from viewing 
    scenic landscapes, such as mountains or water bodies, which is carried across 
    lines of sight and is affected by obstructions or visual blight in between 
    viewers and scenic objects.  Viewshed quality is an important component of the 
    recreational experience for hikers and visitors to scenic drives and overlooks.

    <strong>Biodiversity-based recreation: Bird watching, wildlife viewing, fishing, and hunting:</strong> 
    High diversity and the presence of rare birds and wildlife (for birding and wildlife viewing) 
    or habitat for specific game species (for fishing and hunting) are prerequisites for
    biodiversity-based recreational activities.
