<div id="module-spec-intro" markdown="1">

The coastal storm protection models described here are intended as a proof-of-concept framework 
to spatially link: 1) storm wave sources, 2) ecosystem "sinks" that mitigate wave damage; and 
3) social groups or assets that are susceptible to harm by coastal flooding, via flow models that 
account for wave movement.  These models use historical storm track, wind speed, and atmospheric 
pressure data from tropical storms.  Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and Litanne, three severe storms 
that made landfall near the port of Toamasina in 1994, are used in the first version of this model, 
based on availability of information from Naeraa and Jury (1998). Our model can easily be applied to 
other historical storm tracks in Madagascar, to simulated future storm tracks, or to other simulated 
large wave events, such as tsunamis.  These models, which incorporate important elements of coastal 
process models, can also be relatively easily generalized to other parts of the world, as they rely 
on global datasets for historical storms, coastal ecosystems capable of mitigating storm surges, and 
lives and property at risk of flood damage.  However, the models do not yet incorporate external process 
models to describe storm surge, wave mitigation, or wave run-up, which will be included in future ARIES 
releases.

Please see the [ARIES modeling guide](http://ariesonline.org/resources/toolkit.html) for full documentation 
and references for these models.

## Definitions
---------------

### Coastal flood source

Waves generated by tropical storms or tsunamis, which may threaten human life and property.

### Coastal flood sink

Ecosystems in marine (coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves) and terrestrial (dunes, coastal wetlands, 
etc.) settings that can mitigate potentially damaging waves.

### Model structure and assumptions

**Coastal flood source models.** Developing a generalizable model to predict storm surge height from 
wind speed data is a difficult process, as local coastal geomorphology has a strong influence on surge 
height (NOAA-NHC 2010).  Given the limited spatial data availability for tropical storms in Madagascar, 
we developed an ad hoc Bayesian model to predict storm surge height (available in Naeraa and Jury 1998 
for Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and Litanne) based on wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and ocean 
depth.  We discretized wind speed using Meteo-France's tropical storm rating system for the Southwest 
Indian Ocean (World Meteorological Organization 2006).  We discretized values for atmospheric pressure 
using break points of 970 and 990 mb and values for ocean depth using break points of 200, 50, 20, and 
0 m below sea level.  We set prior probabilities based on corresponding spatial data for Madagascar 
storms and bathymetry.  We set values in the contingent probability table for storm surge size to be 
greatest at lowest pressure, highest winds, and over the shallowest water depths.  We set ocean depth 
as the strongest influence on values in the contingent probability table, followed by wind speed, then 
atmospheric pressure.

**Coastal flood wave sink models.** We consulted the literature on coastal protection to determine which 
variables to incorporate into a Bayesian network to model coastal protection, until existing process models 
can be incorporated in the future as appropriate.  We assume that these coastal ecosystems provide wave 
protection in water depths of less than 50 m and overland, so only activate the model at shallow water 
depths.

We set total coastal flood protection as a function of engineered shoreline protection (artificial coastal 
protection), natural coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, and the influence of tides (with less protection 
provided at high tide than low tide).  We set coastal ecosystem protection as a function of the effects of 
coral reefs (using coral presence and bleaching as a surrogate for their ecological function) and the 
presence of seagrass beds and mangroves.  We set prior probabilities for these variables based on reviews 
of the corresponding spatial data.  We discretized terrestrial vegetation types based on the growth form 
of the dominant vegetation (trees, shrubs, herbaceous, wetland, other), which influences the degree to which 
that ecosystem can dissipate wave energy. 

We assume that coastal regions with greater area, ecosystem health, and density of mangroves, seagrass 
beds, and coral reefs would benefit from greater wave protection.  Seagrasses provide seasonal coastal 
protection during the growing season (Chen et al. 2007), during which most tropical storms occur. 
The combined effects of seagrass, coral, and mangrove coastal protection are nonlinear, which is reflected 
in the contingent probability table for "Coastal ecosystem protection."  In other words, the presence of 
higher quality habitats of more than one ecosystem type is demonstrably more beneficial than the presence 
of a single high-quality habitat alone, so the ecosystem services provided by the coastal seascape are 
often more than the sum of their parts (Barbier et al. 2008, Koch et al. 2009).

In the contingent probability table for "Total coastal flood protection" (aggregating the effects of natural 
and artificial coastal flood regulation), we currently assume that higher-quality natural coastal protection 
is of greater value than artificial coastal flood protection.  This assumption can be revised in the contingent 
probability table where appropriate, but given the extremely limited artificial coastal flood protection in 
Madagascar (near major port cities only), its influence is relatively minor regardless.  We set the influence 
of tides in the contingent probability table as relatively small.  ODINAFRICA (2010) notes that the average 
tides height in eastern Madagascar is only 0.3 m, as compared to 3.2 m on the west coast of Madagascar.  
Naeraa and Jury (1998), however, report an average tide height of around 1.0 m for eastern Madagascar.  Still, 
this is a relatively small influence relative to other coastal regions of the world.  Tidal influence could 
thus be increased in the contingent probability table when the model is applied to regions with a greater tidal range.

**Coastal flood use models.** To map coastal flood use, we identify areas with human life and economic value 
(e.g., housing and other infrastructure) at risk.  Since spatial data exist for population and economic assets 
at risk, no model is necessary.  In parts of the world where coastal flood zones have been mapped, these data 
could be combined with layers of population density, agricultural zones, and housing, infrastructure, or other 
built capital to more precisely map the beneficiaries of coastal flood regulation.

**Coastal flood flow models.** To map the flow of coastal flood waters in ARIES we begin by mapping source 
values for a storm surge located 100 km offshore as described above.  We start the storm 100 km offshore to 
fully attribute storm surge mitigation value to coastal and marine ecosystems while minimizing the distance 
the model must move each storm across open ocean.  We set a storm swath width of 100 km, centered on the 
historical storm track line, meaning that we project a storm surge extending perpendicular to the storm track 
for 50 km on each side.  Costanza et al. (2008) used an analogous but somewhat simpler approach to modeling the 
value of storm protection by coastal wetlands on the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts.   In their study, they also 
used a 100 km wide storm swath, and moved the storm 100 km inland to estimate impacts to people and the ecosystem 
services provided by coastal wetlands that can reduce the storm surge.  While the width of the swath might be 
expected to be related to the storm wind speed, among other variables, Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and 
Litanne had roughly the same wind speed.  We thus use an equal width swath for all three storms, but can easily 
tune this model parameter to be smaller or larger in cases where different storm tracks are used and the relationship 
between storm size and surge width is well understood.

We next move the surge toward land along the historical storm track.  The surge is amplified (over water) or 
diminished (over land and water) based on the area's geomorphology.  The ecosystem service is calculated as 
the mitigation of the storm surge by coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, as opposed to geomorphic features. The 
influence of geomorphic features on the storm surge is modeled using the Bayesian network and data described 
below.  We set geomorphic flood protection as a function of slope (above or below-water), sea floor depth or 
terrestrial elevation, and the presence of dunes.  We discretized slope using category breakpoints from other 
ARIES models (with breakpoints at 1.2, 4.6, and 16.7 degrees) and depth using breakpoints of 2000, 200, 60, and 
0 meters below sea level and 5 and 10 meters above sea level.  We set priors based on reviews of each corresponding 
dataset.  We set values in the contingent probability table for geomorphic flood protection as very low in all 
deepwater and slope regions, protection as higher in shallowly sloped pelagic and shelf areas (as steep slopes 
cause more wave build-up), and set the greatest level of protection in regions above sea level with high slope 
(particularly in the presence of dunes).

Key outputs from the flow models include:

1. Actual wave flow: Wave flows when accounting for their routing and
   sinks that deplete their magnitude.
2. Flood damaging wave source: Waves that actually harm people or
   damage property when accounting for flow paths and sinks.
3. Utilized wave mitigation: Sinks that actively reduce waves,
   providing the benefit of reduced flood damage for people.
4. Flood damage received: Actual damage received by people and
   property when accounting for sources of waves and their sinks and
   flow paths.
5. Absorbed wave flow: Flood flows that are absorbed by sinks prior to
   reaching human beneficiaries of wave regulation.
6. Mitigated wave source: The portion of coastal waves that are
   reduced by the action of wave sinks.
7. Flood mitigation benefits accrued: People or economically valuable
   assets who are spared from coastal flood damage due to the flood
   regulation activity of sinks.
