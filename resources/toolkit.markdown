## Ecosystem Services Explorer
-------------------------------

The ARIES ecosystem service explorer's alpha release took place in
January 2010; the beta release is scheduled for spring 2012. The
online tool, accessed here, provides a user with the ability to map
and quantify ecosystem service flows for eight different ecosystem
services in seven geographic case study regions under baseline
conditions or user-defined scenarios. Please stay tuned for future
releases of the ARIES ecosystem services explorer, which will include
new and updated models and expanded geographic coverage for existing
models.
