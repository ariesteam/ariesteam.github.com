    <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:large">
      In northern New England, a century of forest regrowth following intensive agricultural clearance has led to a landscape 
      dominated small- to medium-scale agriculture and second-growth forests.  These forests provide numerous recreational 
      opportunities, provide employment in the forestry and forest products industries, sequester and store carbon, and provide 
      various other ecosystem services.  Within the region's agricultural and forest communities, there is increasing interest in 
      managing both forests and farmland to increase carbon sequestration and storage and absorb nutrients from waterways.  
      Developing payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and other local 
      policies could support these efforts, but would benefit from emerging ecosystem service models to map and quantify ecosystem 
      services under different management alternatives.

    <hr />
    <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
      Preliminary models of carbon sequestration and storage were developed to assess the sequestration and storage 
      potential of the mixed agricultural and forested landscapes in Vermont. Spatial data for soil, climate, and 
      vegetation characteristics was coupled with prior information on land management techniques to quantify stocks 
      and flows in terrestrial carbon pools. In addition to describing existing carbon sequestration and storage levels, 
      this model could also be used to explore how different land management activities might affect carbon uptake. 
      If through application of novel ecosystem service models, rural working landscapes can be shown to provide 
      substantial carbon uptake potential, this provides motivation for the development of multifunctional agricultural 
      landscapes. Such landscapes might simultaneously sequester carbon (and nutrients) while providing food and energy 
      products for market, demonstrating the role that human managed landscapes play in supplying diverse economic and 
      ecological goods and services.

    <h3 style="color:#6699FF">Practical application: Scenic viewsheds</h3>
    <hr />
    <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
      This project focused on viewshed values associated with viewpoints located within a newly created Nature Conservancy 
      Preserve in the Chittenden County, Vermont.  This 366-acre preserve, Raven Ridge, is located in the towns of Monkton, 
      Charlotte, and Hinesburg. Trails located on the property lead to bedrock outcroppings that afford views over the 
      Champlain Valley and the Adirondacks as well as viewpoints located along Lewis Creek and looking west toward the 
      Green Mountains. Understanding the relative view source values for each viewpoint can help The Nature Conservancy 
      manage for recreation use related to views within Raven Ridge Preserve.  While originally established for an area 
      with relatively small scope (the Raven Ridge Preserve), this model could be expanded and applied more broadly 
      to the Northern Forest region of northeastern United States, particularly the Adirondacks, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

    <hr />
    <p>Following past ecosystem services modeling approaches "causal webs" of factors affecting carbon dynamics in agricultural 
      and forest soils and vegetation were developed. Factors for calculating carbon sequestration provision were derived from a 
      literature review and from available GIS data for climate, soils, and vegetation. The results are a set of preliminary carbon 
      sequestration and storage models for agricultural and forest landscapes in Vermont.<br>
      Past spatial ecosystem service models of terrestrial (i.e. within vegetation and soils) carbon sequestration have focused on 
      forest biomass carbon uptake. However, researchers have also noted the potential for diverse, holistically managed agricultural 
      landscapes to sequester carbon in vegetative biomass as well as soils. Farms of the northeastern United States are diverse 
      landscapes incorporating row crops, grasslands, wetlands and woodlots, which might be managed for both soil and vegetative carbon 
	  sequestration. This research seeks to quantify the role that these diverse farm landscapes can play in terrestrial carbon 
	  sequestration through the application of Bayesian network models.<br>
      A similar process was followed to map viewshed quality and use, based on sources of aesthetically valuable views including 
      mountains, water bodies, and a heterogeneous pattern of land cover representing both forested and agricultural lands.  
      Recreational users of aesthetic views are those people that access view points along trails or at scenic vistas. 
      As a view travels from source to user, it may be physically blocked by buildings, trees, or topography.  Its quality may be 
      depleted by air pollution or visual blight, such as highways, forest clearcuts, or visually unappealing land use types like 
      commercial, industrial, or transportation uses.  Such sources of visual blight can also be mapped using source, sink, use and 
      flow models for viewsheds.
