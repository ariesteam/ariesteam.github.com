# ESS Alpha Web Explorer Notice

<div id="web-explorer-notice" markdown="1">

The ARIES web explorer demo, first released in 2010, is designed to
demonstrate the proof-of-concept use of publicly available spatial
datasets with a small selection of ecosystem service models in
designated geographic case study regions. These case study regions,
datasets, and models are described in the ARIES modeling guide. The
ARIES web explorer does not currently contain scenarios or models with
global geographic coverage, and some models may not run to completion
due to subsequent changes in the ARIES code base.

Since 2013, the ARIES development team has focused our efforts instead
on the development of a stand-alone software tool. This tool uses a
newer, more transparent and powerful modeling language than the code
that currently underlies the ARIES web explorer. As the full
capabilities of the software tool are still under development, the
best ways to learn to use the tool are to participate in an
[ARIES training course](http://www.bc3research.org/springuniversity/)
or through a formal partnership with the ARIES development team. For
inquiries about such opportunities or use of the ARIES software tool,
please contact us at
[info@ariesonline.org](mailto:info@ariesonline.org).

Future plans for the ARIES modeling system include:

1. Wider release of the software tool, once build-out, documentation,
   and testing are complete, enabling independent application of the
   ecosystem services modeling tool.

2. Updates to the ARIES web explorer to integrate new functionality,
   including models with global geographic coverage. Please visit the
   ARIES website or follow us on
   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ARIES-ARtificial-Intelligence-for-Ecosystem-Services/104442313608)
   for updates about these and other developments in the ARIES system.
