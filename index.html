<h1>What is ARIES?</h1>

<p>
ARIES is a web-based technology offered to users worldwide to assist
rapid ecosystem service assessment and valuation (ESAV). Its purpose
is to make environmental decision making easier and more
effective. ARIES helps discover, understand, and quantify
environmental assets and what factors influence their values, for a
geographical area and based on its users' needs and priorities.
</p>

<p>
ARIES follows the open source software paradigm; our goal is to have
unsupervised access to ARIES services open and free for all non-profit
users, including members of NGOs, academic, or governmental
institutions. Non-profit users commit to sharing data in ways that
best reflect their mission and sources, contributing to the growth of
the system over time. Access to ARIES for business and consulting
groups will also be made available through consortium members, whose
proceeds will support the maintenance and growth of the system.
