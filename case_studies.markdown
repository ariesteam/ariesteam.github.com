### Overview
-------------

ARIES was initially developed around a series of case studies, designed
to model multiple ecosystem services across varied ecological and socioeconomc
settings.  Case studies are designed using local, typically high-resolution spatial
datasets and models that account for locally-important ecological and socioeconomic 
variables that influence ecosystem service provision and use. The map below shows 
the ARIES case studies that are currently available. ARIES will eventually incorporate 
a series of generalized global models that rely on coarser scale global spatial datasets 
and generalized relationships to model the provision, use, and spatial dynamics of 
ecosystem services.
