      Application of ARIES in a developing nation with high biodiversity and threats of deforestation.  Development 
      and testing of flow models for marine ecosystem services. Potential to link terrestrial drivers of ecosystem 
      service change (deforestation), changes in ecosystem service flows (sedimentation), and impacts to coastal 
      ecosystems and the ecosystem services they generate.

      A global biodiversity hotspot, Madagascar suffers from high rates of 
      deforestation and poverty.  There has been great interest in targeting 
      incentives for conservation (e.g., carbon credit payments) in areas that 
      will preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.  We initially modeled 
      carbon sequestration and storage and sediment regulation services from 
      forests in Madagascar, and especially their benefits for downstream rice 
      farmers in providing sediment-free water.  ARIES' initial marine ecosystem 
      services models also developed for Madagascar, focusing on coastal storm 
      regulation and subsistence fisheries.  Both of these services are critical 
      for Madagascar, due to its reliance on fisheries for protein and its 
      susceptibility to tropical storms forming in the southwest Indian Ocean.  
      When ARIES' terrestrial and marine ecosystem service flow models are linked, 
      they will provide an unprecedented view of the connections between human 
      well-being and linked marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

      The Madagascar ecosystem services models primarily run on 
      global terrestrial and marine  datasets, supplemented by local data assembled 
      by ARIES partners at Conservation International who have previously worked on 
      ecosystem services.  Based on Wendland et al.'s (2010) work on manually mapping 
      ecosystem services in Madagascar as well as a literature review and discussions 
      with experts, we developed probabilistic models of ecosystem service provision, 
      use, and flows for carbon and sediment Madagascar.  Based on a workshop conducted 
      by UNEP-WCMC to discuss mapping and modeling marine ecosystem service flows, we 
      assembled data and  constructed models for subsistence fisheries and coastal storm 
      regulation in Madagascar.  With completion of ecosystem service flow models as part 
      of ARIES' 2011 beta release, we are now positioned to develop linked marine-terrestrial 
      ecosystem service flow models for Madagascar, which can then be extended and tested 
      in other coastal and marine environments.
