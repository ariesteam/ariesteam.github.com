  Water supply is a critical ecosystem service, and the quantity, quality, 
  and timing of freshwater in surface water bodies and groundwater are important 
  factors in supporting human well-being.  While the role of ecosystems in 
  protecting the quality, quantity, and timing of freshwater flows has long been 
  recognized, payments for ecosystem services programs, particularly in the 
  developing world, are rapidly emerging to protect water supply sources for urban 
  water users.  We map the combined quantity, location, and timing of freshwater 
  flows to particular beneficiary groups (agriculture, industry, domestic use).  
  This provides a clearer view of the dependencies by various human beneficiaries 
  on ecosystems for freshwater.  We can also model water quality by accounting for 
  spatial flows of sediment, nutrients, or pathogens.

      We developed ARIES water supply models for Mexico's La Antigua River in the 
      state of Veracruz.  These models account for water demand from domestic, 
      industrial, and agricultural users.  Model outputs quantify the spatial 
      connections between these users and the threatened cloud forests in the 
      upper watershed that supply much of the region's water. Photo credit: J. Harrison-Cox.

      The San Pedro River, which flows north from Sonora into Arizona, is internationally 
      recognized for its high biodiversity and ecological significance.  On the San Pedro, 
      tradeoffs between human water use and the groundwater and surface flow that support 
      the San Pedro River's riparian ecosystems are at the forefront of debates about population, 
      water use, and sustainability. Photo credit: R.Weller/Cochise College.

    <strong>Freshwater supply: Surface and groundwater:</strong> Surface and groundwater are 
     closely connected but move at different rates and based on different controlling factors.  
     Sources of surface water include precipitation, snowmelt, springs, baseflow to rivers, 
     and incoming interbasin water transfers. As water moves across the surface, it may be 
     lost to evapotranspiration or percolate into the soil to become groundwater.  Conversely, 
     sources of groundwater include areas of infiltration or artificial groundwater recharge. 
     Groundwater movement depends on subsurface geology, and groundwater may eventually return 
     to surface water through springs or discharge of baseflow to rivers.

    <strong>Surface and groundwater users:</strong> Given underlying data on the type 
     of use, user location, and quantity of water extracted from wells or diverted from 
     surface waters, we can show the contributing sources of surface water for particular 
     groups of users (e.g., domestic, agricultural, industrial).  Different user groups 
     may value water differently, enabling ARIES users to explore potential tradeoffs 
     and efficiency gains in different water use and land management scenarios.

  <p style="margin-bottom:15px">
    <strong>Integrating hydrologic models:</strong> Given the difficulty in developing a generalized 
     model of hydrologic processes that is applicable at multiple spatial scales and in different 
     ecological contexts, the initial ARIES water supply models use direct data or Bayesian models 
     tailored to our case study regions but that account for influences on hydrologic processes 
     used by authors of past ecosystem services modeling efforts.  In cases where vegetation-hydrology 
     relationships are poorly understood, such as in tropical forests, ARIES' data-driven modeling 
     approach may be more appropriate than using process-based approaches.  In many other cases, 
     second generation ARIES models will link existing hydrologic models, improving model quality 
     and credibility. Ideally, ARIES would be capable of calling on several hydrologic models, 
     using artificial intelligence to select the correct model for the spatial and temporal scale of 
     analysis and for the relevant ecosystem types.
