      More than 72% of Veracruz's original forest has been converted
      to pastureland and agriculture.  Still, the remaining natural
      vegetation harbors high levels of biodiversity. Forest
      fragmentation and land conversion are now occurring in unique,
      high-elevation montane cloud forest, one of the most important
      land cover types for water provision in the region. Water
      resources are under stress in the basin and flooding is becoming
      increasingly and flooding likely. This has led to unrest over
      water resources between neighboring states and municipalities
      with large population centers on their territory.

    <h3 style="color:#6699FF">Practical application</h3>
    <hr />
    <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
      A majority of people living in ten poor communities in the
      predominantly forested Gavilanes watershed (located above the
      city of Coatepec on the eastern slopes of Cofre de Perote
      volcano) derive their livelihood from small-scale agricultural
      production, forestry, ranching, and extraction of forest
      products. The area also provides water to the city of Coatepec
      and agricultural users.  The conversion of upstream forest to
      agriculture and ranching affects biodiversity and hydrologic
      benefits for downstream beneficiaries. ARIES modeling in La
      Antigua targets data and model development related to water
      provision and regulation (e.g., land cover, land use
      management practices, location of beneficiaries) to support
      conservation of such benefits while maintaining production for
      the diverse economic sectors in the region.

    <p>
      Two preliminary meetings in Xalapa, Mexico between INECOL
      faculty and UVM/CI ARIES researchers were followed by a one-week
      training session at UVM to preliminarily develop a water supply
      model. A subsequent visit from INECOL personnel to UVM helped
      fine-tune the model and provide data prior to the release of the
      first modeling results in February 2011 to an audience of INECOL
      scientists and local decision-makers.  The ecosystem service
      models rely on state of the art data related to the hydrology of
      the montane cloud forest in the region. State-funded monitoring
      projects have produced important datasets relating hydrology to
      socio-economic benefits. This effort integrates with ongoing
      work to assess ecosystem services in the region conducted by
      Conservation International and its partners, with the goal of
      identifying where natural resources management policies could
      most strategically reduce deforestation and biodiversity
      loss.
