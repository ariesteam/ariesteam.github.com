  Erosion and sedimentation are major global problems that impose a 
  high cost on the functioning of ecosystems (e.g. aquatic, coastal, 
  and nearshore marine ecosystems) and economic sectors (e.g., agriculture, 
  water supply, electric power generation, and navigation). Natural sediment 
  delivery can also be a beneficial process.  For instance, sediment pulses 
  can restore fertility to floodplain farmland, and reduced sediment delivery 
  to deltas can lead to loss of coastal wetlands and the critical services 
  they provide.

      Sedimentation is particularly problematic in Madagascar, 
	  where high rates of deforestation and low natural rates of 
	  forest regrowth have led to high levels of erosion. Excess 
	  sedimentation can be particularly damaging to rice fields
      and to coastal and marine ecosystems and the services they provide.

      In the Dominican Republic, sediment loss from intensive 
	  agricultural practices is impacting hydroelectric production 
	  in parts of the country, impeding development efforts and 
	  reducing human well-being. Mapping the costs and benefits 
      of erosion can show the added economic and environmental 
      benefits of shade-grown coffee over intensive agriculture.

      In Western Washington, sedimentation is important for both providing beneficial coarse sediments 
	  (e.g., gravels) for salmon spawning and for avoided siltation of habitat for salmon and other 
      economically beneficial species. Sediment delivery can also have negative impacts on drinking 
      water intakes and recreational use and hydroelectric power generation from reservoirs.

    <strong>Sediment delivery as a beneficial or detrimental service:</strong> Sediment 
    regulation can be classified as either a beneficial or detrimental service, depending 
    on whether the user benefits from or is harmed by sediment delivery.  Running the sediment 
    flow model allows the user to map spatial connections between sources of sediment, 
    areas that promote sediment deposition, and users that benefit from or are harmed by 
    sediment delivery.  We can also run the erosion source model both with and without existing 
    vegetation, showing the benefit of existing vegetation in erosion control or the benefits 
    of increasing vegetation cover on erosion-prone surfaces.

    <strong>Multiple benefits from sustainable forestry and agriculture:</strong> Because 
    of the strong connections between areas of high biodiversity, carbon storage, and 
    erosion control, researchers in many regions are exploring the overlap between 
    areas that provide these services.  ARIES models can help the development of economic 
    incentives for forestry and agricultural practices that reduce erosion while improving 
    carbon sequestration and storage, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services.

    <strong>Intelligent model selection:</strong> Past ecosystem services modeling projects 
    have often relied on the Universal Soil Loss Equation or Revised Universal Soil Loss 
    Equation (USLE/RUSLE) to estimate erosion.  While RUSLE works well in certain environments, 
    it has several well-known limitations.  ARIES can use artificial intelligence to 
    select the right model for the right context: for instance, to use RUSLE to estimate 
    erosion loss in relatively level environments, and to use data-driven Bayesian models 
    to estimate erosion loss on steeply-sloped environments where RUSLE is known to perform poorly.
