      <strong>Highlights:</strong>
      Proof-of-concept for use of ARIES within an urban ecosystem at the project scale. Addresses gaps in the 
	  ecosystem services modeling literature that include accounting for multi-scalar flows, explicit uncertainty, 
	  data limitations, and spatial representation of beneficiaries. Uses real world data to illustrate the use 
	  of a quantitative ecosystem services framework for applications in land management, planning, and environmental 
	  value creation.

      The forces of rapid urban expansion are causing a rise in demand for urban ecosystem services. This swell in demand is also driving 
	  an increase in their perceived value. Therefore, landowners, developers, planners, and cities are keenly interested in how to 
      best manage such environmental assets. The West Coyote Hills property is typical of this phenomenon, and establishes a proof-of-concept 
      for the ARIES approach using real world data at the project site scale (ca. 550 acres).

    <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
      A complete ARIES assessment of West Coyote Hills can help stakeholders to elucidate how much the surrounding community benefits from the 
	  natural functions of the property, in relation to other environmental assets in the watershed. Furthermore, beneficiaries of the carbon 
      sequestration and flood regulation services can be located with precision and the quantity of carbon sequestered and amount of flood 
	  protection provided can be calculated and depicted spatially. Moreover, the ARIES maps can help to inform development siting, ecosystem 
      service management, and different planning scenarios can be tested to provide analysis of alternative management approaches. Developers may 
      also choose to use ARIES as a communication tool to present community-based decisions that are firmly founded in science.

    <hr />
    <p>The West Coyote Hills case study was completed in two phases. In the first phase ecosystem services and their beneficiaries 
	  were identified, from which carbon sequestration and storage and flood regulation were selected for modeling with ARIES. Biophysical, 
      ecological, and socioeconomic spatial datasets were collected and prepared for use with the ARIES system. In phase 2 models were built 
      for carbon sequestration and storage and flood regulation, accounting for regional characteristics of southern California. Further 
      calibration of the models was performed based on preliminary sensitivity analyses and data were integrated into the system for model 
      runs. Then, source, sink, use, and flow simulations were performed resulting in spatial outputs. A total of 16 maps were produced, each 
      providing unique information about how the ecosystem services are generated at West Coyote Hills and delivered to the end users throughout 
      the watershed and beyond.  We have not yet completed a third phase, consisting of post hoc sensitivity analysis and optimization techniques, 
      which would yield actionable model outputs to fully support local decision making.
