ARIES redefines ecosystem services assessment and valuation in
decision-making. The ARIES approach to mapping benefits,
beneficiaries, and service flows is a powerful new way to visualize,
value, and manage the ecosystems on which the human economy and
well-being depend.

### A web-based technology

ARIES is a suite of applications, all delivered to end users through
the Web. All applications have been designed with the help of
professional usability engineers, and are accessible through a
standard web browser. Along with the main toolkit (Ecosystem Services
Explorer, Valuation Database, and Biodiversity Explorer), custom ARIES
interfaces can be built to simplify use by specific groups of end
users.

### Focus on conservation

ARIES can help improve our understanding of the value to humans of
conserving high biodiversity areas. At the same time, it can help
conservation planning by identifying crucial areas to protect the flow
of ecosystem services to their beneficiaries. ARIES is being used in
Madagascar to plan conservation and enhance its value for local
communities.

### Focus on business

ARIES can help reduce impact and engender positive change by
prioritizing the conservation of ecosystem services flows to local
communities and locating critical flow areas to protect and enhance in
order to achieve positive offsetting of the consequences of
operations.  These applications can help businesses reduce liability,
maintain and improve a positive corporate image, and explore new
revenue streams.

### Managing tradeoffs for public lands

ARIES is being tested, along with other ecosystem service tools, for
use in comparing tradeoffs between extractive resource use and
ecosystem service provision on public lands.  As these lands come
under greater pressure for resource use, quantifying associated
ecosystem service tradeoffs becomes critical in protecting service
flows to various beneficiary groups.

### Linking terrestrial and marine services for coastal management

By accounting for biophysical flows of ecosystem services across the
landscape, ARIES can link marine and terrestrial habitats as never
before.  For example, we can model flows of sediment, nutrients, and
freshwater from land to nearshore ecosystems, allowing us to model
change in provision of marine ecosystem services based on changing
land use practices.  ARIES' initial marine case study is being
developed in Madagascar through a partnership with UNEP's World
Conservation Monitoring Center.

### Climate change and ecosystem services

ARIES can be used to generate scenarios to explore changes in
ecosystem service provision and use based on changes in ecosystem
service supply or demand.  By using climate change scenarios that
account for changes in precipitation or other climate variables, we
can predict changes to ecosystem services under various potential
climate futures.
