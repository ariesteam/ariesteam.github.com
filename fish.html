  Many rural communities around the world depend on fisheries as a key 
  protein source. Sustainable fisheries management requires an 
  understanding of the linkages between deforestation, erosion,  
  sediment and nutrient transport processes that take place on land
  and flow through rivers but strongly affect coastal and marine 
  environments.

      Subsistence fisheries models for Madagascar rely on global 
                    spatial datasets for fisheries, population density, and poverty, 
                    combined with data on national fisheries use.  In Madagascar the 
                    species we modeled subsistence use of three species: sky emperor 
                    (<i>Lethrinus mahsena)</i>, slender emperor (<i>Lethrinus variegatus)</i>, 
                    and mangrove red snapper (<i>Lutjanus argentimaculatus)</i>. Since 
                    underlying data are available for all nations, it is feasible to 
                    extend coverage of the ARIES subsistence fisheries model to other 
                    countries by simply accounting for the degree of dependence on 
                    specific fish species for each nation.

    <strong>Subsistence fisheries:</strong> Subsistence harvesting of
    ecosystem goods - food, fuel, fiber, and other basic resources - 
    is a critical contributor to livelihoods in much of the developing 
    world as well as in parts of developed nations.  These ecosystem 
    goods have been termed the "GDP of the poor," since they provide 
    employment and livelihoods for so many of the world's poor while 
    not being monetized as part of traditional national economic accounts.  
    Societal dependence on subsistence fisheries, combined with the 
    recognition that the world's oceans are in crisis due to overfishing, 
    pollution, and climate change strongly argues the case for more 
    sustainable management of aquatic and marine resources.  By mapping 
    societal dependence on subsistence fisheries, we can demonstrate direct 
    linkages between ecosystems and human well-being.</p>
