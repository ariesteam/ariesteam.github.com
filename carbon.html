  Forests, grasslands, and other ecosystems store and remove
  CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and serve as natural sinks for
  emissions that would otherwise contribute to global warming. ARIES
  helps quantify and map: 1) carbon sequestration, the removal of
  CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, 2) the potential release of
  stored carbon in vegetation and soils through deforestation or fire,
  3) other CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from human activities.  By mapping
  these processes, we can provide coarse-scale estimates of regional
  carbon balance while enabling analysis of tradeoffs between carbon
  sequestration and storage and other ecosystem services.

      ARIES is being used to help understand spatial patterns of
      carbon sequestration and storage in vegetation and soils.
      Accurate assessments of ecosystem carbon balance are a critical
      component for landowners interested in participation in emerging
      global carbon markets. In developing world contexts like
      Madagascar, carbon markets can potentially help finance
      conservation activities, if carefully planned.

      ARIES is being used to help planners understand tradeoffs
      between carbon sequestration and storage and other ecosystem
      services, such as timber harvests, flood control, and water
      supply in the Pacific Northwest forests. Careful consideration
      of these tradeoffs will be important as climate change policies
      continue to evolve.

      Carbon sequestration and storage estimates are increasingly
      demanded by public and private land managers in the southwest
      and beyond.  ARIES' application to Southeast Arizona provided
      estimates of carbon sequestration and storage on public and
      private lands in this semiarid region. Photo credit:

      Carbon sequestration and storage were mapped for a key parcel of
      undeveloped land in southern California.  Given the state's
      leadership in carbon accounting, such assessments will become
      increasingly important in managing conservation and development
      tradeoffs.

      Vermont's low population density and high forest cover make the
      state a net sink for carbon emissions.  There is great interest
      among the state's agricultural and forestry communities in
      developing sustainable forestry and agricultural practices that
      increase carbon sequestration and storage and other ecosystem
      services.  Tools like ARIES can help map and quantify such
      ecosystem services tradeoffs.

    <strong>Carbon sequestration and storage</strong> by terrestrial
    ecosystems is the net removal of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
    from the atmosphere, with carbon being stored in vegetation or
    soils. CO<sub>2</sub> uptake occurs through photosynthesis in all
    green plants. Terrestrial carbon sequestration levels depend on
    factors including climate, vegetation type, soils, and current and
    past land use practices.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
    <strong>Stored carbon release</strong> can occur when fire, land
    use change, deforestation, or other vegetation and soil
    disturbances release the carbon stored in vegetation and soils
    back to the atmosphere.  The quantity of carbon released depends
    on the amount of carbon currently stored in vegetation and soils
    and the type and extent of the disturbance.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
    <strong>Anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon emissions</strong>
    result from the burning of fossil fuels and the subsequent release
    of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere.  Since greenhouse gas
    emitters benefit from the waste absorption capacity of the
    biosphere, carbon sequestration and storage can be divided among
    emitters.  Existing and proposed systems to cap and assign
    property rights to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions use this
    framework.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
    In other words:<br />
    <strong>Carbon sequestration - Stored carbon release = Carbon emissions offset</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
    <strong>In summary,</strong> by mapping levels of carbon
    sequestration, stored carbon release, and anthropogenic emissions
    in a common unit (tonnes C/yr), we can fully describe regional
    carbon balances - the level of a region's net release or uptake of
    atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.  This will become increasingly
    important as local, state, and national governments continue to
    inventory greenhouse gas emissions and implement strategies to
    address climate change.
