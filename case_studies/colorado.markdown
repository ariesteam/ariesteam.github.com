### Overview
-------------

Colorado's Rocky Mountains provide well-recognized benefits through
water supply to the Platte, Arkansas, Rio Grande, and Colorado Rivers
and recreational visits to millions of acres of National Forest and
National Park lands. Similarly, the Bridger-Teton and Shoshone national 
forests in northwest Wyoming form the headwaters of the Snake, Green, and Wind/Bighorn
rivers, and are critical ecological components of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
Key management challenges include fire management
after almost a century of fire suppression, outbreaks of mountain pine
beetle, which have killed large numbers of lodgepole and ponderosa
pines, resulting in changes to forest structure, and the impacts of
climate change on snowpack. By mapping ecosystem service provision and
beneficiaries, we can better illustrate management tradeoffs in these
charismatic ecosystems.

### Practical application
--------------------------

These models are designed to illustrate tradeoffs in forest management and "social values" for ecosystem services -
spatially explicit survey information that shows places where people
directly value the landscape for cultural services ecosystem services (Sherrouse
et al. 2011). In this case study, we are conducting the first
"social-ecological hotspots mapping" (Alessa et al. 2008) exercise to
be based on modeled ecosystem service values and survey-based social
values for ecosystem services.

### Steps
----------

We adapted ARIES carbon sequestration and storage, aesthetic
viewsheds, sediment regulation, and water supply ecosystem services
models to account for locally-important ecological and socioeconomic
characteristics in Colorado. Past social values mapping using the
[Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) tool (Sherrouse et al.
2011)](http://solves.cr.usgs.gov/) has taken place on the Pike-San
Isabel, Arapahoe-Roosevelt, White River, Medicine Bow-Routt, Bridger-Teton, and Shoshone National Forests. We are
exploring spatial correlation and hotspots of modeled ecosystem
service provision and surveyed social values and the potential
management implications within hotspots and coldspots of ecosystem
services and social values.
