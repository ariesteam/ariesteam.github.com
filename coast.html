 High-profile tropical storm and tsunami events including the Indian Ocean 
 tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 spurred great interest in 
 understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in mitigating storm surge damage.  
 In recent decades, population growth and coastal migration have placed more 
 people and property at risk of coastal flooding, and have also damaged or caused 
 outright loss of coastal ecosystems capable of mitigating flood damage.  In addition, 
 climate change threatens to lead to sea level rise and an increased number and size 
 of tropical storms, which would further increase coastal flood risk.  These intersecting 
 drivers mean that valuing and managing coastal ecosystem services is important today 
 and will become even more so in the future.

      Eastern Madagascar is highly susceptible to tropical storms 
	  coming off the southern Indian Ocean. The island's coastal ecosystems 
      include dunes, coral reefs, seagrass, and mangroves, all of which play 
      a role in dissipating wind and wave energy generated by coastal storms.  
      Given Madagascar's high deforestation rates and the links between 
      sedimentation and coastal ecosystem health, modeling spatial flows of 
      these processes is important for understanding how to maintain the services 
      provided by coastal and marine ecosystems.<br />

    <strong>Tropical storm and tsunami protection by coastal ecosystems:</strong> Spatial data 
    and process models of tropical storm probability can help quantify storm surges in ARIES. 
    ARIES then provides quantitative maps of the specific areas in the ecosystems where wave and 
    wind mitigation occurs. Wave mitigation can be provided through engineered shoreline 
    protection or natural ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems providing wave mitigation include 
    mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs.  In our models we assume that coastal regions with 
    greater density, health, and area of these ecosystem types would receive greater wave protection 
    than artificial coastal flood protection, and that the combined effects of seagrass, coral, and 
    mangrove ecosystems on coastal protection are nonlinear. Tide levels and the slope of the ocean 
    floor are also important determinants of wave run-up or mitigation.

    <strong>Beneficiaries of coastal flood protection:</strong> As with other modules, ARIES accounts
    for spatial flows when mapping provision of costal flood protection, in order to distinguish 
    between theoretical and actual service provision. Theoretical wave sources, sinks (areas where 
    ecosystems dissipate wind and wave energy), and beneficiaries are first mapped. These maps show 
    the location of wind and wave origins, areas capable of wave mitigation, and potentially             
    vulnerable populations.  Applying flow algorithms to these initial theoretical states of wave        
    sources, mitigation, and vulnerable lives or property produces a clear quantification of the         
    <b>amount of service benefit</b> produced by different areas and actual recipients of                
    <b>different levels</b> <b>of the service</b>. By excluding sinks (areas of active wave              
    mitigation), ARIES can also quantify possible damages in the absence of natural or artificial        
    mitigation structures.</p>
