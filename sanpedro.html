      The San Pedro River, which flows north from Sonora into 
	  Arizona, is internationally recognized for its high biodiversity 
	  and ecological significance. A long history of scientific research 
      in the watershed exists to support ecosystem services research on 
      the watershed.

    <p style="margin-bottom:24px">
     Much of the Upper San Pedro River's riparian corridor is managed by the 
     Bureau of Land Management (BLM)'s San Pedro Riparian National Conservation 
     Area, yet the perennial flow supporting these reaches is threatened by 
	 groundwater withdrawals. The project site was chosen as a test case to 
     evaluate alternative ecosystem services modeling and valuation tools for 
     the BLM, and included an evaluation of ARIES models. Ideally ecosystem services 
     assessments could thus inform decision making for the BLM in the San Pedro watershed 
     and agency-wide, as well as for other federal agencies responsible for public 
     land management.

     An initial stakeholder meeting was held to prioritize ecosystem services for 
     analysis. These included water, carbon, biodiversity, and cultural services.
     From this list, we developed a list of concrete beneficiary groups for 
	 mapping and valuation. For example, we identified water for agriculture, 
     mining, domestic use, and the military as separate beneficiary groups. We 
	 built models to identify areas that provide ecosystem services (sources), 
     locate beneficiaries on the landscape (uses), and identify "sink" features 
     that biophysically alter ecosystem services flows. Agent-based flow models 
     then link beneficiaries to ecosystems providing the services, showing the 
     strength of dependencies on ecosystem services and opportunities to protect 
     or improve ecosystem service flows. This work has also included iterative 
     model reviews with experts to improve the quality of the data sources, models, 
     and outputs and with decision makers to improve the usefulness of outputs for 
     decision making. Completion of this project is set for Summer 2011, and will 
     include the release of a publicly available USGS Scientific Investigations Report 
     detailing the strengths and limitations of alternative ecosystem services valuation 
     and modeling tools.
