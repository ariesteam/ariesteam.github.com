  Floods are complex events, difficult to predict and even more
  difficult to protect against. Typically, a watershed's hydrology is
  poorly understood; weather is notoriously difficult to forecast.
  Using every tool of modern science, we cannot predict the next big
  flood. Human land use and development, as well as climate change,
  are transforming the "playing field" of flood protection. Decisions
  on flood protection have generally been based on hydrological
  modeling which provides a best guess at decade, 100, or 500 year
  flood levels. The topography, vegetation, soils, hydrology, flood
  creating rain events, impermeable surfaces, levees, dams, locations
  of farms, residents, businesses, and public infrastructure are all
  important factors in flooding, safety, and flood protection.

      In May 2010, <a href="http://www.eartheconomics.org">Earth
      Economics</a> completed a comprehensive Ecosystem Service and
      Flood Protection Analysis for the Chehalis Basin in Washington
      State. Ecosystem services, such as flood protection are
      concerned with the way natural systems affect people. With this
      in mind, ARIES produces four types of models, based on GIS and
      other data: 1) Beneficiary models; 2) Provisioning models; 3)
      Sink models and 4) Flow models.

      ARIES was used to quantify flood protection throughout the San
      Gabriel River/Coyote Creek watershed in northwestern Orange
      County, California.  A higher-resolution analysis of flood
      regulation provided by an undeveloped 600-acre site being
      considered for development was also conducted.  Southern
      California is characterized by its flash flood system due to the
      runoff-prone topography, climate, and highly urbanized land
      cover, where floods can reach full peak in a matter of minutes.
      These factors make the identification and protection of natural
      flood regulating regions vital to sustainable urban
      development.

    <strong>Flood regulation and its beneficiaries:</strong> ARIES
    maps sources of floodwater as precipitation or snowmelt, "sinks"
    of floodwater as areas that promote infiltration or detention of
    floodwater, and beneficiaries of flood regulation as homeowners,
    farmers, or users of public infrastructure within floodplains.
    Flood mitigation can occur via natural "green infrastructure"
    designed to promote natural infiltration and dispersal of
    floodwater, or engineered "gray infrastructure" such as dams,
    detention basins, and levees.  Flow models show the areas that
    contribute floodwater to a specific area at risk of flooding.  By
    comparing baseline conditions with scenarios to manage green
    infrastructure (e.g., forest management, levee setbacks) or gray
    infrastructure (constructing new flood control works), we can
    compare alternative levels of ecosystem service provision against
    life cycle costs of such investments.

    <strong>Event-based modeling:</strong> ARIES currently models
    flood vulnerability based on coarse-scale data (e.g., annual or
    monthly average precipitation and snowmelt).  Collecting data to
    support event-based modeling is difficult, as it requires
    fine-scale estimation of soil, streamflow, and weather conditions.
    We will seek to include existing flood models and their outputs in
    next generation ARIES models, increasing the accuracy and policy
    relevance of model outputs.  Even in their current form, however,
    ARIES flood model outputs are useful in comparing vulnerability
    and exploring tradeoffs between multiple ecosystem services in
    alternative scenarios for flood management.
